# Exercise 5: Enhanced Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

## Objective
This exercise focuses on securing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by integrating multiple security checks into your CI/CD pipeline. You will learn how to detect and mitigate security risks in your infrastructure configuration files using automated tools.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform.
- Familiarity with CI/CD concepts.
- Experience with GitHub Actions.
- A GitHub repository to host your project.

## Tools Used
- **Terraform**: For managing infrastructure as code.
- **Checkov**: For scanning Terraform configurations to detect security and compliance issues.
- **TFLint**: For linting and checking best practices in Terraform code.
- **tfsec**: For static analysis security scanning of Terraform code.
- **Terraform Validate**: For validating Terraform configuration syntax and structure.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating IaC security checks in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Repository Structure
Your repository should be structured as follows:

```plaintext
ex5-iac-security/
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── iac-security.yml
├── main.tf
└── variables.tf

## Explanation of the Workflow:

Checkout code: Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
Set up Terraform: Configures the Terraform environment.
Install TFLint: Installs TFLint for linting Terraform code.
Run TFLint: Checks Terraform code for best practices and potential issues.
Install Checkov: Installs Checkov for scanning Terraform code for security and compliance issues.
Run Checkov: Scans the Terraform configuration for security risks.
Install tfsec: Installs tfsec for static analysis of Terraform code.
Run tfsec: Scans the Terraform code for security issues.
Run Terraform Validate: Validates the Terraform configuration syntax and structure.

# Running the Pipeline
1. Trigger the Pipeline: The GitHub Actions pipeline will automatically run on every push or pull request.

2. Monitor the Pipeline: Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the pipeline's progress.

3. Review and Fix Issues: If any security issues or violations are flagged by TFLint, Checkov, tfsec, or Terraform Validate, fix them in your code and push the changes. The pipeline will re-run automatically to verify the fixes.#

By completing this exercise, you have set up a CI/CD pipeline that includes enhanced security checks for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. The pipeline ensures that your infrastructure is secure and compliant before it is deployed, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities in your cloud environments.
